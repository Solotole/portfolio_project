This project is for those book reading enthusiasts who desire to post the stand on a book piece and every facet it potrays and also to view what other users think of the same book. It offers a beacon on which books they should read judged by the ratings and reviews by other enthusiasts.
In this project i looked to design a Book Review and Reccomendation System in which a user can login, register for an account, logout, view all books offered by the we
 web app. the user can also review a specific book and he/she felt and saw the book by clicking on the word review under the book. the user can also view all reviews form all users by clicking on the the word view of the specific he/she would like to see all reviews. if at all the user desires to update a review he/she can can do so by clicking on the word update and he/she will be prompted for a review comment and a rating from 0 being the worst possible piece and 10 being the best. if at all the user feels to delete the review he can do so by clicking on the word delete and an action will occur in the back-end to meet with user's desire.
There is also a way he user can mark a book if he/she ha read it before by clicking on the red button Mark. if the user desires to view the list of all books marked from previously he can go to the profile navigation and there will see the books marked from before and the all the properties.
To run the application and test on localhost you use 2 commands:
